# How to Recover a Deleted Git Branch from GitHub

If you have deleted a branch on your local machine but it still exists on GitHub, you can easily recover it. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Check GitHub for the Deleted Branch

1. Go to your repository on **GitHub**.
2. Click on the **"Branches"** tab.
3. Look for the branch you want to recover. If itâ€™s there, you can proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Open Your Terminal

Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or any terminal you use).

## Step 3: Fetch Remote Branches

Run the following command to update your local repository with the latest changes from GitHub:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This command will bring the latest information about the branches from the remote repository.

## Step 4: List All Branches

To see a list of all branches, including remote branches, run:

```bash
git branch -a
```

Look for your deleted branch in the list. It should appear as `remotes/origin/<branch-name>`.

## Step 5: Checkout the Deleted Branch

To recover your deleted branch locally, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the actual name of your branch. This command creates a new local branch that tracks the remote branch on GitHub.

## Step 6: Verify the Branch is Recovered

To check if the branch has been restored, run:

```bash
git branch -vv
```

This will show you the current branches and confirm that your recovered branch is now tracking the remote branch.

You have successfully recovered your deleted branch from GitHub! You can now continue working on it as needed.
